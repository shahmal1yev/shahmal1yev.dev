## About Me

As an experienced Software Engineer focused on PHP development, I have a solid background in designing, building,
and maintaining scalable and testable systems. I am proficient in object-oriented programming (OOP) principles,
design patterns, and complex architectures, delivering maintainable and high-performance software solutions. I am
expanding my knowledge in Java to diversify my professional opportunities in international markets. With a passion
for low-level programming, I aspire to create developer tools, programming languages, and potentially operating
systems. I am committed to contributing to open-source projects and aim to establish a nonprofit foundation that
unites valuable open-source solutions.

My key strengths include promoting clean code practices, implementing the best design patterns, and delivering
high-quality, reusable code for enterprise-level applications.
